Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped by more than 5% on July 5 to a quarterly low of 79.50 terahashes per second. This marked the largest reduction since March when it briefly dipped below 80 TH/s. Difficulty spiked between March and May, reaching an all-time high of 88.10 TH/s before slowly settling to where it currently stands. Under the current difficulty measure, mining pool F2Pool estimates that an ASIC rig with a watts per terahash efficiency rate of 26 or better would be profitable as long as Bitcoin’s price doesn’t dip below the $54,000 threshold.
