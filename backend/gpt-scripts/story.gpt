description: creates text, images, audio and subtitles info for a short video content
args: link: Link to the article or page
args: dir: Directory to save the files to

Do the following sequentially, do not run in parallel. Always overwrite files.
1. Browse to ${link} and read the page content
2. Create a tldr text version of it (no emojis) for an instagram reel / tiktok video. The text should take around 12 seconds to read. It should start with a hook to make the video more viral and interesting.
3. Split the created text into 3 parts.
4. Save each text part to ${dir} directory with filename story-$INDEX.txt
5. For each text part, generate speech file and save to mp3 file with name "voiceover-$INDEX.mp3"
6. For each text part, come up with a keyword or a phrase for b-roll image.
7. Generate those images.
8. Wait for the images to be generated.
9. Download the images and save each image to the ${dir} directory with filename starting with b-roll-$INDEX.png
10. Files with name like voiceover-X.mp3.mp3 (that you created), inside ${dir} directory contains speech audio that I want you to convert to text. 
11. Save the conversion results (whole json responses) into files with names like "transcription-X.json"
