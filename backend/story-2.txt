Bitcoin mining difficulty is measured in hashrate, which is the number of guesses a mining machine should be expected to make before it solves the cryptographic puzzle necessary to unlock one of the remaining Bitcoin. Hashrates are updated every 2,016 blocks, which takes approximately two weeks. With few exceptions, during Bitcoinâ€™s lifetime, hashrate has typically grown month-to-month.
